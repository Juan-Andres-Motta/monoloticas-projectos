    title="Alpes Partners BFF API",
    description="""
    Backend for Frontend service for Alpes Partners platform.

    This API provides unified access to campaign management, evidence upload,
    and payment request functionality. All endpoints require JWT authentication.

    ## Authentication

    All endpoints (except health checks) require a valid JWT token in the Authorization header:

    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
    ```

    Use the JWT generation script to create test tokens:
    ```bash
    cd bff && python generate_jwt.py
    ```

    ## Event Flow

    This BFF publishes commands to Apache Pulsar topics:
    - `bff-campaign-accept-v1` - Campaign acceptance commands
    - `bff-evidence-upload-v1` - Evidence upload commands
    - `bff-payment-request-v1` - Payment request commands

    These commands are processed by future microservices (not tracking/commission).
